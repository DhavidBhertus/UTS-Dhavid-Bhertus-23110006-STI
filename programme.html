                <p class="desc5">
                    I recomended this programme in ITBSS for people who are interested in this things. But for me 
                    , after I have studied in here for 2 semester, I think it's not my type of things. More things 
                    I learn in here and I become more & more regret following my brother's footsteps. However like
                    I said before, I highly recomended for you who are serious and want to learn about IT very much.
