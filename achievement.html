                        My first cup in my whole life. This is my first win on a competition and it was an amazing experience.
                        I didn't really wish to win at first because I just answered 5 from 40 questions in the first stage and I got through it fortunately.
                        It happened continuously until I got into the Final Stage and became the 1<sup>st</sup> Runner-up. Thanks to my high school physics teachers. Now,
                        I like physics very much and attend to learn more about this topics.
