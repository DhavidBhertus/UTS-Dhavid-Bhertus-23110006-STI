                    education level organized by the Protestant Church Foundation of Kampung
                    Bali (YGPKB), which is an extension of the sevice mandated by the West
                    Kalimantan Christian Church (GKKB) Congregation of Pontianak in the field
                    of education, and with the spirit of Indonesian nationalism and unity, 
                    on October 13th, 2019, the Higher Education Department (KomDikti) was formed
                    by YGPKB Pontianak with the aim on establishing a higher education institution

                    <h2 class="sub-title4">My Testimony</h2>
                    <p class="desc5">
                        ITBSS has 3 undergraduate programs, such as <a href="programme.html">System Information & Technology</a>, Digital Business, and Enterpreneurship. 
                        This is my second semester at Information System & Technology programme as a student. First about the assignments,
                        lecturers always give us so many assignments to do and some lectures give 2-3 assignments at the same time. Well,
                        in my opinion, if these assignments are to increase our knowledge about the lessons then its fine. Next about the
                        lessons, like the other universities in Pontianak, lecturers in here don't teach to much in class. Students must
                        study by themself at home especially the students that have never study about Information System & Technology before.
                        Last, there are so many courses related to the religion. Students always study about Christian religion every year in 
                        here and sometimes it feels like we are in Theology undergraduate programme. Anyway, ITBSS is Christian based college.
                        So, you must get used to it when you are studying right here.
